Create a sort of a pipeline for deployment using Git, Jenkins & Apache:
Build virtual machines using Vagrant, Vagrant is responsible for setting up the VirtualBox VMs with a pre-configured file to deploy.
The deploy.sh file is already included with the Vagrantfile, deploy.sh is responsible for downloading and installing the required packages.
